# Algos
Just a collection of various algorithms I encountered during my journey as developer. For each of them I try to add some notes to describe the rationale and the derivation.

## Table of Contents
- [SO(3)](./so3/so3.pdf): Lie group and Lie algebra for 3D rotation matrices
- [Umeyama-Kabsch](./umeyama_kabsch/umeyama_kabsch.pdf): find best alignment between two set of corresponding points
- [Unscented transform](./unscented_transform/unscented_transform.pdf): estimate the result of applying a nonlinear transformation to a probability distribution characterized by its mean and covariance

>All the material here has been developed just for fun and curiosity. The code might be not the best algorithm implementation and the notes may contain errors. If you have found any errors or you have suggestions let me know! :smile:
